DESCRIPTION

timelimit is a a wrapper to any command that ensures it
does not run for more than <timeou> seconds

SYNTAX

  timelimit <timeout> <command> [<arg> ...]

Exit code of the wrapper is the exit code of the command.
If the command did not finish in given timeout it is
killed, so the exit code is the usual exit code of killed
processes (in my case its 143).

EXAMPLE

  timelimit 10 wget http://github.com/

Runs wget http://github.com/
If this ends within 10 seconds its output and exit code is
just the same as wget's. If it takes more than 10 seconds,
the command is killed and exit code is non-zero

TESTS

  timelimit 10 sleep 5 && echo OK

This should print OK, because sleep 5 should end in about 5
seconds, while the limit is 10.

  timelimit 5 sleep 10 || echo OK

This should print OK too, because time limit is 5 seconds,
the command will try to take 10 seconds and we print OK if
the command fails. The whole thing should take about 5
seconds.
